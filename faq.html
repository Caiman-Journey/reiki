                Reiki is a form of alternative therapy that promotes your inner
                peace and well-being. Benefits of Reiki include reducing stress,
                improving sleep and helping to heal the mind and body. Reiki is
                a very relaxing and healing experience that treats the person on
                the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual level.
