          our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research

          considered to be "selling" of your personal data. **Caiman Journey.com** has

          personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal
          information, we will respect your request and delete your personal

          legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect
          against illegal activities. - Right to be informed - Request to know:
          Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know: whether we

          need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
          about whom we have the information in our system. These verification
          efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
          match it with information you have previously provided us. For
          instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you
          to provide certain information so that we can match the information
          you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
          contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that
          you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
          methods as the circumstances dictate. We will only use personal
          information provided in your request to verify your identity or
          authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid
          requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
          verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
          information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
          additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity,
          and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
          additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

          personal data. You may request correction of your personal data if it
          is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing
          of the data. you can designate an authorized agent to make a request
          under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an
          authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
          validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
          you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal
          information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we
          will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later
          than 15 days from the date of the request submission. To exercise
          these rights, you can contact us by email at legal@Caiman Journey.com, or by
          referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If
          you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to
