          our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research
          for technological development and demonstration. This is not
          considered to be "selling" of your personal data. **Caiman Journey.com** has
          not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a

          personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal
          information, we will respect your request and delete your personal
          information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as
          (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her
          right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a
          legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect
          against illegal activities. - Right to be informed - Request to know:
          Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know: whether we
          collect and use your personal information; the categories of personal
          information that we collect; the purposes for which the collected
          personal information is used; whether we sell your personal
          information to third parties; the categories of personal information
          that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose; the categories of
          third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed
          for a business purpose; and the business or commercial purpose for
          collecting or selling personal information. In accordance with
          applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer
          information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or
          to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request. - Right
          to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights:
          We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy
          rights. - Verification process: Upon receiving your request, we will
          need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
          about whom we have the information in our system. These verification
          efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
          match it with information you have previously provided us. For
          instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you
          to provide certain information so that we can match the information
          you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
          contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that
          you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
          methods as the circumstances dictate. We will only use personal
          information provided in your request to verify your identity or
          authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid
          requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
          verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
          information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
          additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity,
          and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
          additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

          personal data. You may request correction of your personal data if it
          is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing
          of the data. you can designate an authorized agent to make a request
          under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an
          authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
          validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
          you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal
          information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we
          will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later
          than 15 days from the date of the request submission. To exercise
          these rights, you can contact us by email at legal@Caiman Journey.com, or by
          referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If
          you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to
          hear from you.
